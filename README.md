## Getting started

### Step 1: Define a Case Base Table

Create a table to store your case base. 
This table will have columns representing 
the features of the problem (solar_irradiance,temperature,humidity,soilPH,crop_area)
and the corresponding solutions (irrigation_duration,flow_rate,nozzle_type,water_application_rate).

### Step 2: Populate the Case Base
Insert relevant cases into the case_base table. These cases should include both the input features (problem) and the corresponding solutions.
### Step 3: Retrieve Similar Cases
When a new problem is presented, retrieve similar cases from the case_base table based on the input features (solar irradiance, temperature, humidity, soil pH). You can use a distance metric such as Euclidean distance or other similarity measures.
### Step 4: Adapt the Solution
Once you have retrieved similar cases, adapt the solution to fit the current problem. This adaptation process can involve averaging the solutions, selecting the solution from the most similar case, or other methods based on the specific requirements of your application.

### Step 5: Implement CBR Logic
Implement the logic to handle new problems using the retrieved cases and adapted solutions. This may involve writing functions or methods to perform the retrieval and adaptation steps.
### Step 6: Test and Iterate
Test your CBR system with various new problems and refine the logic as needed. This may involve tweaking the similarity metric, adaptation strategy, or other parameters to improve the system's performance.
